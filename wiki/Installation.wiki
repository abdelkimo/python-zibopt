#summary Installing python-zibopt

= Building & Installing python-zibopt =

== Prerequisites ==

The python-zibopt build script assumes that you have shared object files for ZIMPL, SoPlex and SCIP in your LIBRARY_PATH and header files for SCIP in your C_INCLUDE_PATH.  Make sure these are in your environment before building it.  For example, if you put the ZIBOpt shared object files in $HOME/lib after building it in $HOME/src, your environment might contain: 

{{{
LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME
C_INCLUDE_PATH=$HOME/src/ziboptsuite-1.1.0/scip-1.1.0/src/
}}}

To build the shared library versions of ZIBOpt components, you'll need to use their opt-shared makefiles.  Look [http://scip.zib.de/doc/html/MAKE.html here] for more information.

Other required libraries include:
  * setuptools
  * gmp
  * ncurses
  * readline
  * z

python-zibobt should be built against Python 2.6 or later.  It is not yet compatible with 3.0.

== Installation ==

Either download the latest stable release and uncompress it, or if you'd rather run the bleeding edge code, use svn to get the latest version:

{{{ 
$ svn checkout http://python-zibopt.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ python-zibopt 
}}}

Now build the extension libraries:

{{{
$ cd python-zibopt

python-zibopt$ python setup.py build 
running build
running build_py
creating build
[... snip ...]
gcc -pthread -shared -Wl,-O1 -Wl,-Bsymbolic-functions build/temp.linux-i686-2.6/src/ext/solnmodule.o -llpispx -lobjscip -lscip -lsoplex -lzimpl -lreadline -lncurses -lgmp -lz -o build/lib.linux-i686-2.6/zibopt/_soln.so
}}}

Test the library to make sure it is in working order:

{{{
python-zibopt$ python setup.py test
running test
running egg_info
[... snip ...]
Test solver restart ... ok
Solutions should be false when unbounded ... ok
Test incorrect mixing of variables and solvers ... ok

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 11 tests in 0.096s

OK
}}}

And finally install it:

{{{
python-zibopt$ sudo python setup.py install 
}}}

You should now be able to do this without getting any errors:

{{{
python-zibopt$ ipython
