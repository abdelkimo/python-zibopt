= 0.2 dev =
  * Issue 1: Added gap and absgap keywords to maximize/minimize to stop when gap is within a certain limit
{{{ 
solver.maximize(absgap=0.5, gap=100) 
}}}
  * Issue 1: Added time keyword to maximize/minimize to return best solution after a number of seconds
{{{ 
solver.maximize(time=500) 
}}}
  * Removed solution.feasible, added solution.infeasible, unbounded, inforunbd, and optimal
  * Tested against SCIP 1.2
  * Issue 2: Added ability to change priority, maxdepth, and maxbounddist on branching rules:
{{{
solver.branching['inference'].priority = 10000
solver.branching['mostinf'].maxdepth += 2
print(solver.branching['pscost'].maxbounddist)
}}}

= 0.1 dev =
  * Initial libraries for interfacing to solver, variables, constraints, and solutions
  * Ability to turn off solver verbosity
  * Solutions are false in case of infeasibilty or unboundedness
  * SCIP errors get mapped to Python exception types
  * The solver can be restarted with additional constraints and variables
  * Primal solutions can be fed to minimize/maximize and are checked for feasibility
