= 0.2 dev =
  * Added gap and absgap keywords to maximize/minimize to stop when gap is within a certain limit
  * Added time keyword to maximize/minimize to return best solution after a number of seconds
  * Removed solution.feasible, added solution.infeasible, unbounded, inforunbd, and optimal

= 0.1 dev =
  * Initial libraries for interfacing to solver, variables, constraints, and solutions
  * Ability to turn off solver verbosity
  * Solutions are false in case of infeasibilty or unboundedness
  * SCIP errors get mapped to Python exception types
  * The solver can be restarted with additional constraints and variables
  * Primal solutions can be fed to minimize/maximize and are checked for feasibility
