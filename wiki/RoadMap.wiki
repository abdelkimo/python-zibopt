#summary Where is python-zibopt going?

= Road Map =

There isn't an explicit road map for the project yet.  Some features you can expect to see in future releases include, in no particular order:

  * Access to SCIP settings
  * The ability to stop the solver after a certain amount of time or when the primal/dual gap shrinks a certain size
  * Serialization of problem instances using pickle or json files
  * The ability to write and prioritize branching rules, heuristics, presolving, and other SCIP components in Python
